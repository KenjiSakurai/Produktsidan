    <div class="centered"> The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES),[b] commonly shortened to Super NES or Super Nintendo,[c] is a 16-bit home video game console developed by Nintendo that was released in 1990 in Japan and South Korea,[17] 1991 in North America, 1992 in Europe and Oceania, and 1993 in South America.
         In Japan, the system is called the Super Famicom (SFC).[d] In South Korea, it is known as the Super Comboy[e] and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics.[18] The system was released in Brazil on August 30, 1993,[17][19] by Playtronic. Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of regional lockout 
         prevent cartridges for one version from being used in other versions.
